# Programming Assignment: Neural Machine Translation

## Instructions

<div class="cmlToHtml-content-container" style="white-space: pre-wrap">
    <p>Welcome to your first programming assignment for this week!</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>You will build a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate human-readable dates ("25th of June,
                2009") into machine-readable dates ("2009-06-25").</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>You will do this using an attention model, one of the most sophisticated sequence-to-sequence models.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This notebook was produced together with NVIDIA's Deep Learning Institute.</p>
