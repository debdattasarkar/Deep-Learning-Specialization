        <li>
            <p>R​evised <em>public test</em> for <em>Exercise 3</em>.</p>

    <p>If you are opening the assignment for the first time after this date and time:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>If you had previously worked on the assignment, you'll now have the latest version with the name
                <em>Tensorflow_introduction.ipynb </em>and the version you were working on named with date and time of
                the update appended at the end, <em>Tensorflow_introduction_date_time.ipynb.</em>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you didn't work on the assignment before then you'll see only one assignment version, which will be
                the latest, with the name, <em>Tensorflow_introduction.ipynb.</em>
            </p>

    <p>Thank you.</p>

    <p>Welcome to the fifth and final (required) assignment of Course 2 of the Deep Learning Specialization! In this
        notebook, you'll explore TensorFlow, a deep learning framework that allows you to build neural networks more
        easily, and use it to build a neural network and train it on a TensorFlow dataset. </p><img

    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <p>- Avoid using for-loops and while-loops, unless you are explicitly told to do so.</p>
    <p>- After coding your function, run the cell right below it to check if your result is correct.</p>
    <p>Take your time to complete this assignment and make sure you get the expected outputs when working through the
        different exercises. When you see the following:&nbsp;with the result:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;All tests passed.</p>
    <p>...You’re in good shape. :)&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Some code blocks contain graded functions, where you’ll be expected to write some code. These are marked at the
        top of the block by a #GRADED FUNCTION comment, and you’ll write your code in between the ### START SOLUTION
        HERE ### and ###END SOLUTION HERE### comments. Also, look for another comment that indicates roughly how many
        lines of code it will take to complete the graded function.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>After you are done, submit your work and check your results. You need to score 70% to pass. Good luck! :)&nbsp;

    <p>Click on "My Submission" above to see your grades. It might take up to one minute for the graders to process your
        submission. You will see the point breakdown of your assignment, along with the grader feedback.</p>
