    <p>Welcome to the first assignment of Course 2 of the Deep Learning Specialization! Training your neural network
        requires specifying an initial value of the weights. A well-chosen initialization method helps the learning
        process. In this notebook, you'll try out a few different initializations and see how they lead to different
        results. </p><img src="images/Screen-Shot-2020-10-08-at-3.12.17-PM.png" alt="" />
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <p>- Avoid using for-loops and while-loops, unless you are explicitly told to do so.</p>
    <p>- After coding your function, run the cell right below it to check if your result is correct.</p>
    <p>Take your time to complete this assignment and make sure you get the expected outputs when working through the
        different exercises. When you see</p>
    <p>&nbsp;All tests passed.</p>
    <p>...You’re in good shape. :)&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Some code blocks contain graded functions, where you’ll be expected to write some code. These are marked at the
        top of the block by a #GRADED FUNCTION comment, and you’ll write your code in between the ### START SOLUTION
        HERE ### and ###END SOLUTION HERE### comments. Also, look for another comment that indicates roughly how many
        lines of code it will take to complete the graded function.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>After you are done, submit your work and check your results. You need to score 70% to pass. Good luck! :)&nbsp;

        submission. You will see the point breakdown of your assignment, along with the grader feedback.</p>
