# Programming Assignment: Regularization

## Instructions

<div style="white-space: pre-wrap">
    <p>Welcome to the second (required) assignment of Course 2 of the Deep Learning Specialization! In this notebook,
        you'll apply L2 regularization and dropout to a deep learning model that recommends positions to football
        players. Your "goal" (pun intended) is to avoid overfitting and make better recommendations to the goal keeper.

    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <p>- Avoid using for-loops and while-loops, unless you are explicitly told to do so.</p>
    <p>- After coding your function, run the cell right below it to check if your result is correct.</p>
    <p>Take your time to complete this assignment and make sure you get the expected outputs when working through the
        different exercises. When you see the following:&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;All tests passed.</p>
    <p>...You’re in good shape. :)&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Some code blocks contain graded functions, where you’ll be expected to write some code. These are marked at the
        top of the block by a #GRADED FUNCTION comment, and you’ll write your code in between the ### START SOLUTION
        HERE ### and ###END SOLUTION HERE### comments. Also, look for another comment that indicates roughly how many
        lines of code it will take to complete the graded function.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>After you are done, submit your work and check your results. You need to score 70% to pass. Good luck! :)&nbsp;

        submission. You will see the point breakdown of your assignment, along with the grader feedback.</p>
